# Executive Finance Dashboard (Tableau)

An interactive CFO-style finance dashboard built in Tableau to quickly understand performance across Divisions and Regions over time.
Created as part of my Research Assistant (RA) work.

## What this project shows
- High-level KPIs (Revenue, Gross Profit, Operating Income, Net Income, etc.)
- Monthly trends with a metric selector (switch between key financial metrics)
- Year-over-year (YoY) comparison to spot growth/decline
- Income statement waterfall showing how Revenue flows down to Net Income
- Filters for Division and Region to drill into specific segments
